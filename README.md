# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

## Overview

This repository houses my Python solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each day's challenge has its own folder named inside the respective year's collection named `day_xx` where `xx` represents the date. Each day contains a `.py` (solution code) and a `.txt` (puzzle input) file. When required, a second `.txt` can be found, which is a testing subset of the input given in the puzzle description on the AOC website.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are intended for personal reference and learning purposes. They may not be the most optimal or perfect solutions.

Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a reference but keep in mind that understanding and solving the challenges on your own is highly encouraged.
